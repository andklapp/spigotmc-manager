# TODO
[ ] Add options for all the prompts in `install.sh`.
[ ] During builds, only build if the repository is actually updated.
[ ] Be consistent with test functions. Are you using [ or [[?
[ ] Look into running the server in a tmux session instead of managing mcrcon updates.
[ ] Decide whether and how to handle updates for this tool.
[ ] Consider putting mcrcon and spigot in /usr/local instead of the home directory.
